ðŸš€ **bLog** is a blazingly fast tool for for viewing log files. It makes other tools feel like they're stuck in slow-motion...

## Day 9 update
Learning how `ratatui` rendering works. I am looking for an efficient way to display a huge amount of logs. I will most likely use pagination with incremental rendering. We will see tomorrow.

## Day 13 update
A day spent trying to add a horizontal scroll bar to my log view. It turned out that this is not easy because `ratatui` does not provide an out of the box solution. I need to figure out how to modify the current solution. Maybe I will create my own widget?

## Day 15 update
Thank God it's Friday. A day spent briefly analyzing how could I write my own widget in `ratatui`. Is seems to be quite complex, especially the issue of optimal widget rendering.

## Day 21 updata
Thinking about how to properly implement SOLID principials.

## Day 22 updata
